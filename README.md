## spotify-recommendations

This is a pet project of mine, playing around with the Spotify Public API to get music recommendations based on seeds/parameters not found in the actual Spotify App.

Written in React using create-react-app.

This is currently a work in progress. Will update this Readme once the app is fully functional.
